# Tax assignment

## Project information
* This program takes a list of products and outpits the total price including tales and import taxes. 
* This project was created using Maven and Spring.
* Since the input comes in the form of a string, most of the functionality revolves around interpreting and transofming the information contained in said string. 
* The model–view–controller (MVC) design pattern was mostly bypassed since the product information was hard-coded due to the simplicity of the requirements. 

## Build

1. Clone this repository
2. Run App.js
3. Enter products including the following information: 
* Number of products
* In case the product is imported, declare it so
* Product name
* Price
4. Enter "Checkout"
## Example input: 
* 1 chocolate bar at 0.85
* 1 imported bottle of perfume at 27.99
